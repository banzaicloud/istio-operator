# Istio-operator

Istio-operator is a Kubernetes operator to deploy and manage [Istio](https://istio.io/) resources for a Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

[Istio](https://istio.io/) is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices and it is emerging as the `standard` for building service meshes on Kubernetes. It is built out on multiple components and a rather complex deployment scheme (around 14 Helm subcharts and 50+ CRDs). Installing, upgrading and operating these components requires deep understanding of Istio and Helm (the standard/supported way of deploying [Istio](https://istio.io/)).

The goal of the **Istio-operator** is to automate and simplify these and enable popular service mesh use cases (multi cluster federation, canary releases, resource reconciliation, etc) by introducing easy higher level abstractions.

### Motivation

At [Banzai Cloud](https://banzaicloud.com) we are building a Kubernetes distribution, [PKE](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pke) and platform, [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline) and operate managed Istio clusters for our customers. While we were comfortably operating Istio using the standard Helm deployments on 6 cloud providers and on-premise with [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline), recently our customers were asking for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud service mesh deployments. This required lots of configurations, manual interventions during scaling or removing clusters from the mesh and become an operational burden. [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline) automates the whole Kubernetes experience (from creating clusters, centralized logging, federated monitoring, multi-dimensional autoscaling, disaster recovery, security scans, etc) and we needed a way to `automagically` operate Istio across multiple clouds and on-premise hybrid-cloud environments.

At the same time there is a huge interest in the Istio community for an [operator](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9333), but due to resource constraints and the need of supporting Helm, building one it was discarded. There were several initiatives to simplify Istio:

- [Istio Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9333)
- [Operator](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/10015)
- [Initial implementation of Galley registers the CRDs](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/10120)
- [Handle upgrades with an istio-init chart](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/10562)

however, none of these gave a full solution to **automate** the Istio experience and make it consumable for the wider audience. Our motivation is to build an open source solution and a community which drives the innovation and features of this operator.

## Installation

The operator (`release-1.5` branch) installs the 1.5.0 version of Istio, and can run on Minikube v1.1.1+ and Kubernetes 1.13.0+.

As a pre-requisite it needs a Kubernetes cluster (you can create one using [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline)).

1. Set `KUBECONFIG` pointing towards your cluster
2. Run `make deploy` (deploys the operator in the `istio-system` namespace to the cluster)
3. Set your Istio configurations in a Kubernetes custom resource (sample: `config/samples/istio_v1beta1_istio.yaml`) and run this command to deploy the Istio components:

```bash
kubectl create -n istio-system -f config/samples/istio_v1beta1_istio.yaml
```

### Installation with Helm

Alternatively, if you just canâ€™t let go of Helm completely, you can deploy the operator using a Helm chart, which is available in the Banzai Cloud stable [Helm repo](deploy/charts/istio-operator):

```bash
helm repo add banzaicloud-stable https://kubernetes-charts.banzaicloud.com/
helm install --name=istio-operator --namespace=istio-system banzaicloud-stable/istio-operator
```

### Installation with Kustomize

You can also have your own `kustomization.yaml` file with a reference to Istio operator as a base without the need to clone the repo. See more info in the [Kustomize usage doc](config/README.md).

```bash
bases:
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.5
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/auth-proxy-enabled?ref=release-1.5
```

### Installation with Backyards

Go grab and install the [Backyards CLI](https://github.com/banzaicloud/backyards-cli) tool.

```bash
backyards istio install
```

## Istio upgrade

Check out the [upgrade docs](docs/upgrade.md) to see how to upgrade between minor or major Istio versions.

## Multi-cluster federation

Check out the [multi-cluster federation docs](docs/federation/README.md).

## Development

Check out the [developer docs](docs/developer.md).

## Uninstall

To remove Istio and Istio operator completely from your cluster execute the following steps:

1. Delete the Istio configuration custom resource you have created earlier (Istio operator will take care of deleting all Istio resources from your cluster after the custom resource is deleted)
2. Delete the `istio-system` namespace to delete Istio operator itself

```bash
kubectl delete -n istio-system -f config/samples/istio_v1beta1_istio.yaml
kubectl delete namespace istio-system
```
