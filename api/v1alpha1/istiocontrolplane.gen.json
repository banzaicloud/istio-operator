For example, the kube-system namespace (e.g. the Kube API Server). - A mesh administrator wants to slowly migrate services to Istio. They might start by first having services cluster-local and then slowly transition them to mesh-wide.

In a typical Envoy deployment, the `service-cluster` flag is used to identify the caller, for source-based routing scenarios. Since Istio does not assign a local `service/service` version to each Envoy instance, the name is same for all of them.  However, the source/caller's identity (e.g., IP address) is encoded in the `--service-node` flag when launching Envoy.  When the RDS service receives API calls from Envoy, it uses the value of the `service-node` flag to compute routes that are relative to the service instances located at that IP address.",

For additional detail refer to [Locality Weight](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/locality_weight) The following example shows how to setup locality weights mesh-wide. Given a mesh with workloads and their service deployed to \"us-west/zone1/*\" and \"us-west/zone2/*\". This example specifies that when traffic accessing a service originates from workloads in \"us-west/zone1/*\", 80% of the traffic will be sent to endpoints in \"us-west/zone1/*\", i.e the same zone, and the remaining 20% will go to endpoints in \"us-west/zone2/*\". This setup is intended to favor routing traffic to endpoints in the same locality. A similar setting is specified for traffic originating in \"us-west/zone2/*\". ```yaml distribute: - from: us-west/zone1/* to: \"us-west/zone1/*\": 80 \"us-west/zone2/*\": 20 - from: us-west/zone2/* to: \"us-west/zone1/*\": 20 \"us-west/zone2/*\": 80 ``` If the goal of the operator is not to distribute load across zones and regions but rather to restrict the regionality of failover to meet other operational requirements an operator can set a 'failover' policy instead of a 'distribute' policy. The following example sets up a locality failover policy for regions. Assume a service resides in zones within us-east, us-west \u0026 eu-west this example specifies that when endpoints within us-east become unhealthy traffic should failover to endpoints in any zone or sub-zone within eu-west and similarly us-west should failover to us-east. ```yaml failover: - from: us-east to: eu-west - from: us-west to: us-east ``` Locality load balancing settings.",

Endpoints matching all N labels with the client proxy have priority P(0) i.e. the highest priority. 2. Endpoints matching the first N-1 labels with the client proxy have priority P(1) i.e. second highest priority. 3. By extension of this logic, endpoints matching only the first label with the client proxy has priority P(N-1) i.e. second lowest priority. 4. All the other endpoints have priority P(N) i.e. lowest priority. Note: For a label to be considered for match, the previous labels must match, i.e. nth label would be considered matched only if first n-1 labels match. It can be any label specified on both client and server workloads. The following labels which have special semantic meaning are also supported: - `topology.istio.io/network` is used to match the network metadata of an endpoint, which can be specified by pod/namespace label `topology.istio.io/network`, sidecar env `ISTIO_META_NETWORK` or MeshNetworks. - `topology.istio.io/cluster` is used to match the clusterID of an endpoint, which can be specified by pod label `topology.istio.io/cluster` or pod env `ISTIO_META_CLUSTER_ID`. - `topology.kubernetes.io/region` is used to match the region metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Kubernetes node label `topology.kubernetes.io/region` or the deprecated label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region`. - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` is used to match the zone metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Kubernetes node label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` or the deprecated label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`. - `topology.istio.io/subzone` is used to match the subzone metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Istio node label `topology.istio.io/subzone`.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that: a. No precision is lost b. No fractional digits will be emitted c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Examples: 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\" Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
