# Kustomize usage

Developers can have their own `kustomization.yaml` file with a reference to Istio operator as a base without the need to clone the repo.

You can install the operator with multiple possible configurations with the use of overlays (choose one option):

> Note that in all cases, first you'll need to install the necessary crds and namespace with the following base: `github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.3`

- `basic`: installs the clusterrole, clusterrolebinding and statefulset for the operator

```bash
bases:
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.3
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/basic?ref=release-1.3
```

- `auth-proxy-enabled`: besides the basic configs, installs the auth proxy resources as well

```bash
bases:
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.3
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/auth-proxy-enabled?ref=release-1.3
```

- `prometheus-scpraping-enabled`: besides the basic configs, enables Prometheus scraping for the manager pod

```bash
bases:
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.3
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/prometheus-scpraping-enabled?ref=release-1.3
```

- `psp`: besides the basic configs, add basic pod security policy for the operator and the Istio component pods

```bash
bases:
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.3
  - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/psp?ref=release-1.3
```
