# Kustomize usage

Developers can have their own `kustomization.yaml` file with a reference to Istio operator as a base without the need to clone the repo.

You can install the operator with multiple possible configurations with the use of overlays (choose one option):

> Note that in all cases, first you'll need to install the necessary crds and namespace with the following base: `github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.9`

- `basic`: installs the clusterrole, clusterrolebinding and statefulset for the operator

    ```bash
    bases:
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.9
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/basic?ref=release-1.9
    ```

- `auth-proxy-enabled`: besides the basic configs, installs the auth proxy resources as well

    ```bash
    bases:
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.9
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/auth-proxy-enabled?ref=release-1.9
    ```

- `prometheus-scpraping-enabled`: besides the basic configs, enables Prometheus scraping for the manager pod

    ```bash
    bases:
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.9
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/prometheus-scpraping-enabled?ref=release-1.9
    ```

- `psp`: besides the basic configs, add basic pod security policy for the operator and the Istio component pods

    ```bash
    bases:
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config?ref=release-1.9
      - github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator/config/overlays/psp?ref=release-1.9
    ```

    The default istio init container runs as root, which won't work in this psp enabled case, so make sure that you use Istio CNI, e.g. with the `samples/istio_v1beta1_istio_cni.yaml` Istio CR.
